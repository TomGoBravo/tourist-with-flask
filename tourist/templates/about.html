    <li><a
        href="https://github.com/TomGoBravo/tourist-with-flask/issues/new?assignees=&labels=field+report&template=new-information-for-the-uwh-tourist.md&title=%5BAdd+short+description+such+as+name+of+place+to+update%5D">Create a new report from the field</a> on GitHub</li>

<li> <b>City/Town: </b> ***
<li> <b>Contact Information: </b> *** Please give us a Name AND email and/or telephone;  we will be happy to list any additional contact information you like.  However, we can't list a club unless our visitors can reach you.  Note!  If you give us a contact address that is different from the address of a practice location, please make this clear so that we do not accidentally send strangers to your home expecting an underwater hockey game!
<li> Club Name:
<li> Practice locations: For each pool, the name, address and a link to Google Maps works well
<li> Practice times
<li> Website, Facebook group, Meetup, etc

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
Thanks for visiting the Underwater Hockey Tourist website. Did you know that this site has been up and running since '96? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://home.worldonline.co.za/~despev/uwht">Lisa de Speville in South Africa</a> founded it and in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020722142434/http://pucku.org/tourist/">2002</a> the Houston Underwater Hockey Trust started maintaining it at pucku.org. In 2006 Tom started contributing technical help, moving the data to an XML file, adding a map and effort to cull stale data. Chris has continued applying updates sent by email and in 2019 Tom changed the server to a more modern <a href="https://github.com/TomGoBravo/tourist-with-flask">open source Python-Flask system</a>.</p>
